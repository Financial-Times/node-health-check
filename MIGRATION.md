# Migration

## Migrating from v3 t v4

The `graphite-threshold` check has now been removed in line with the deprecation of the Graphite service. We recommend removing this check from your code and following [Edge Delivery and Observability's guide to replacing Graphite](https://financialtimes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/8408989698/Migrating+an+app+away+from+Graphite-based+health+checks):

```diff
const health = new HealthCheck({
    checks: [
-        {
-		name: 'ES Search',
-		id: 'es-search',
-		severity: 3,
-		businessImpact: 'Unable to add related content to videos, potentially impacting engagement',
-		technicalSummary: 'Check there hasnâ€™t been a 500 response from the Elasticsearch search endpoint in the last 10 minutes',

    {
        type: 'disk-space',
        threshold: 80,
        interval: 15000,
        id: 'system-disk-space',

        severity: 2,
        businessImpact: 'New files may not be saved',
        technicalSummary: 'Something went wrong!',
        panicGuide: "Don't panic",
    },
  ]
});
```
