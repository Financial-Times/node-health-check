Usage
-----

### Requirements

Running the Health Check module requires [Node.js] 6.x and [npm]. You can install with:

```sh
npm install @financial-times/health-check
```

### API Documentation

This library makes use of [promises] â€“ familiarity is assumed in the rest of the API documentation. You'll also need to require the module with:

```js
const healthCheck = require('@financial-times/health-check');
```

### `healthCheck( [options] )`

This function returns a new health check object. You can configure the health checks with [an options object](#options) if you need to override any defaults.

```js
const health = healthCheck({
    checks: [
        // ...
    ]
});
```

### Options

The Health Check module can be configured with a variety of options, passed in as an object to the `healthCheck` function. The available options are as follows:

  - `checks`: An array of healthcheck configuration objects. Defaults to an empty array
  - `log`: A console object used to output logs. Defaults to the global `console` object

### Examples

You can find example implementations of health checks in the `examples` folder of this repo:

  - **Basic:** create and run some simple health checks:

    ```sh
    node examples/basic
    ```
