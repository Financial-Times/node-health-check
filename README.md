Usage
-----

### Requirements

Running the Health Check module requires [Node.js] 6.x and [npm]. You can install with:

```sh
npm install @financial-times/health-check
```

### API Documentation

This library makes use of [promises] â€“ familiarity is assumed in the rest of the API documentation. You'll also need to require the module with:

```js
const HealthCheck = require('@financial-times/health-check');
```

### `new HealthCheck( [options] )`

This function returns a new health check object. You can configure the health checks with [an options object](#options) if you need to override any defaults.

```js
const health = HealthCheck({
    checks: [
        // ...
    ]
});
```

The [given checks](#health-check-configurations) start polling immediately at the intervals that you specify. The returned instance has several methods for reading this data.

#### `health.checks()`

This returns a health check function that's compatible with the [Express Web Service] module. The returned function returns a promise which resolves to a JSON-friendly copy of the health check data.

Assuming you've already included [Express] and [Express Web Service]:

```js
app.use(expressWebService({
    healthCheck: health.check()
}));
```

#### `health.gtg()`

This returns a good-to-go function that's compatible with the [Express Web Service] module. The returned function returns a promise which resolves to either `true` or `false`.

`false` will be the resolved value if any of the health checks with severity `1` are failing.

Assuming you've already included [Express] and [Express Web Service]:

```js
app.use(expressWebService({
    goodToGoTest: health.gtg()
}));
```

#### `health.toJSON()`

Get the health check output as an array that's safe for converting to JSON. You can use this if you don't intend on using the [Express Web Service] module.

### Options

The Health Check module can be configured with a variety of options, passed in as an object to the `HealthCheck` constructor. The available options are as follows:

  - `checks`: An array of [health check configuration objects](#health-check-configurations). Defaults to an empty array
  - `log`: A console object used to output logs. Defaults to the global `console` object

### Health Check Configurations

Each health check can be configured as an object. These follow the [FT health check standard], which has more information, and there are [examples](#examples) available to help you out. No matter what type of check you're adding, there are some common required properties:

  - `type`: The type of the check. One of `memory`, `ping-url`. Additional configurations required by these types are documented below
  - `businessImpact`: The business impact of the health check as a string
  - `id`: The unique ID of the health check as a string. Must use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
  - `name`: The name of the health check as a string.
  - `panicGuide`: The panic guide for the health check as a string.
  - `technicalSummary`: The technical summary for the health check as a string.

There are also some common optional properties:

  - `severity`: The severity level of the health check if it is failing. Must be one of `1` (high), `2` (medium), `3` (low)
  - `interval`: The number of milliseconds to wait between checks. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds)

Different types of check may have additional config properties. These are documented below.

#### Check Type: Memory

The `memory` type requires some additional configuration:

  - `threshold`: The maximum memory usage (as a percentage) that is allowed before the check will fail. Defaults to `75`

#### Check Type: Ping URL

The `ping-url` type requires some additional configuration:

  - `url`: The URL that the check should ping
  - `method`: The HTTP method to use when pinging the URL. Defaults to `"HEAD"`

### Examples

You can find example implementations of health checks in the `examples` folder of this repo:

  - **Basic:** create and run some simple health checks:

    ```sh
    node examples/basic
    ```
